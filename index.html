                  <li>This source is from Hong Kong Observatory (<a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/climate_change/climate_change_hk.htm" target="_blank">https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/climate_change/climate_change_hk.htm</a>) so I think this is a reliable source.</li>
                  <li>The picture on the left is telling us how Hong Kong is changing in each year.</li>
                  <li>This picture is telling us that the hot days are getting more and cold days are lesser, the temperature add 1.2 degrees celsius every year.</li>
                  <li>According to the water cycle. When the weather gets hotter rainfall will get more frequent, then the mean sea Level rise 3mm each year. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>For the second picture, we can see that the line in the digraph rise in the year between 2000 - 2009 had risen a lot and people think that it will continue rising in the future.</li>
                  <li>From the digraph, the date in 1960 - 1969 and 1990 - 1999 had risen more than 0.5 degrees celsius. </li>
                  <li>For 2000 - 2009, the temperature had risen 0.3 degrees celsius that 9 years. </li>
                  <li>From the report Hong Kong Observatory gave us in 2010, in the results of IPCC AR4, for the forecast of rainfall in Hong Kong, the average rainfall is expected to increase about 11% at the end of the century. </li>
                  <li>In the 64 years after the Second World War (1947-2010), the annual rainfall at the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters has risen to 50 mm/year.</li>

                    <li>In the third picture, it is telling us the number of Hot nights.  </li>
                    <li>The number has increased as the years increase, you can see the line is going up throughout the year.  </li>
                    <li>The number of hot days had increased in the year of 1964, then it decreases again. </li>
                    <li> It is also increasing in the year of 2004, it had been rising since then. As you can see, the number of hot days and nights had increased in the year of 2014. </li>
